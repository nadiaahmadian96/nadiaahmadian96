## About

I’m an **iOS developer** with a background in **software engineering**, focused on building **clean, reliable, and user-centric applications**.  
My work emphasizes **clarity in architecture**, **thoughtful UI/UX**, and **maintainable code** aligned with real product goals.

I enjoy working across the full lifecycle of an app — from idea and design to implementation, iteration, and delivery — and I’m especially interested in projects where **engineering quality and user experience matter equally**.
